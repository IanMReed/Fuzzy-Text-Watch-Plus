Swedish fuzzy text watch
========================

This watchface is based on the PebbleTextWatch by waerewip (https://github.com/wearewip/PebbleTextWatch)

I wanted to combine the elegant layout and animations of the TextWatch with the natural language of
the Fuzzy Time watchface and I wanted it in my native language, Swedish.

Features
--------
 - Fuzzy time in natural language with 5 minute precision.
 - The large and easy to read fonts of the original Text Watch
 - Nice staggered animation
 - Between one and four lines of text, depending on need.
 - The text rows are always centered vertically
 - Smaller words may share a single line (such as "fem i")
 - Refactored code for better flexibility/rewriteability
 - Buzz and message when bluetooth connection is lost
 - Configurable colors
 - Supports all pebble models up to and including Pebble Time Round

ToDo
----
 - [x] Configurable languages in one app
 - [ ] Optional bluetooth lost icon
 - [ ] Configurable time offset (when the watch switches time)
 - [ ] Configurable text alignment
