Fuzzy Text watch Plus
========================
This is a watch face for the [Pebble smartwatch](http://www.getpebble.com). It is based on the
[PebbleTextWatch](https://github.com/wearewip/PebbleTextWatch) by waerewip

I wanted to combine the elegant layout and animations of the TextWatch with the natural language of
the Fuzzy Time watchface and I wanted it in my native language, Swedish.

I have since then added more languages, colors, connection lost notifications and more...

Features
--------
 - Fuzzy time in natural language with 5 minute precision.
 - Several languages are supported.
 - The large and easy to read fonts of the original Text Watch
 - Buzz and message when bluetooth connection is lost
 - Configurable colors
 - Supports all pebble models up to and including Pebble Time Round
 - Configurable time offset for the shown five minute period
 - Nice staggered animation
 - Between one and four lines of text, depending on need.
 - The text rows are always centered vertically
 - Smaller words may share a single line (such as "ten to")
 - Refactored code for better flexibility/rewriteability

Possible future features
----
 - [ ] More languages
 - [ ] Configurable text alignment
 - [ ] Optional bluetooth lost icon
 - [ ] Shake to show date
 - [x] ~~Configurable time offset (when the watch switches time)~~
 - [x] ~~Configurable languages in one app~~
